## Summary

Sno is going to be a personal ski app where users who enjoy skiing or snowboadring can customize a profile that has the mountains they ride, gear they own, rider skill level, etc. There will be a section in the app where the user can check real time stats for the mountains of their choosing. Trail maps can also be found within the mountain page.

## Intended users

* People who like to ski or snowboard

    > As someone who goes skiing often, I want to be able to see local mountain weather and log my gear to keep track of my days.

* People who are interested in the mountain stats and weather

    > As someone who can go skiing at multiple mountains, I want to be able to easily see each mountains weather forecast, base depth, and status so I can easily decide if I should go skiing that day, go to a different mountain, or just cancel for that day.
