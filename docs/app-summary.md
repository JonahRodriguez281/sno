## Description

### Known Deficiencies:

  * Resort fragment does not display the current weather through the API on the resulting WeatherFragment.
  
  * Accelerometer does not incorporate the sensor within the Android device using the Motion Sensor to track your speed in real time.
  
  * In the Profile screen, there is no way to add items to the Favorite Ski Resorts.
  
  * In the Profile screen, gear cannot be added into the database or deleted.
  
  * Unknown if days logged and distance traveled can be added from within the application, instead of injecting it into the database through the SnoDatabase class.
  
  * No API to get a list of all ski resorts available to populate the RecyclerView in the Resort screen.
  
  * Preference screen does not change anything within the application.
 
### Cosmetic Enhancements:

  * Better screen layouts for Accelerometer and Profile.
  
  * More material design elements, incorporating more shadows and three-dimensional elements along the Z-axis.
  
  * A custom weather fragment screen that displays weather information akin to a weather app.
  
### Stretch Goals:

  * Using an API to retrieve a myriad number of ski resorts that displays stats about the resort, such as trail maps, open chairlifts, open trails, etc.
  
  * Accelerometer that works and records your fastest speed.
  
  * A favorite section for adding the ski resorts from the API to a list of favorites for easy access.
  
  * Adding/deleting gear
  
  * Preference screen with more options such as displaying different units of measurement and a dark mode for the application.
  
  * Real time gps tracking that tracks the users vertical feet and can post their stats to a leaderboard. The real time tracking can see what trails the user has taken and compare it to the trail map.
  
  * Save weather data for ski resorts to the server to see the latest weather report prior to going offline.
